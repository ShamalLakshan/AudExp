# AudExp: Audio Experimentation Project

Welcome to the AudExp repository! This project houses a collection of audio-related experiments I've conducted with the ultimate goal of developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for audio upsampling.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of these experiments is to deepen my understanding of various audio processing techniques and their applications. By exploring different approaches and methodologies, I aim to gather insights that will contribute to the future development of an advanced audio upsampling CNN.

## Index of Experiments

### 1. Enhancing Audio Using Spectral Inprinting

Spectral inprinting is a technique that involves manipulating the frequency spectrum of an audio signal to improve its quality or characteristics. In this section, we explore two main approaches:

#### 1.1 Harmonic Enhancement

This experiment focuses on enhancing the harmonic content of audio signals. By identifying and boosting specific harmonic frequencies, we aim to improve the overall tonal quality and richness of the audio.

Key aspects:
- Identification of fundamental frequencies
- Harmonic series analysis
- Selective frequency boosting
- Before and after comparisons

#### 1.2 Reconstruction Techniques

In this experiment, we explore methods for reconstructing missing or degraded parts of audio signals using spectral information. This can be particularly useful for restoring old recordings or improving the quality of low-fidelity audio.

Key aspects:
- Spectral analysis of degraded audio
- Identification of missing frequency components
- Techniques for spectral interpolation
- Evaluation of reconstruction quality

## Future Directions

The knowledge gained from these experiments will be instrumental in designing and implementing an upsampling CNN. Some potential areas for future exploration include:

- Time-domain vs. frequency-domain approaches
- Integration of phase information in the upsampling process
- Exploration of different CNN architectures for audio processing
- Comparative analysis with existing upsampling techniques
